This includes solving obvious scalability issues as well as auxillary questions which demonstrate your command of system design.",
      "The degree to which a candidate should proactively lead the deep dives is a function of their seniority. In this problem, all levels should be quick to point out that my single-host solution isn't going to scale. But beyond these bottlenecks, it's reasonable in a mid-level interview for the interviewer to drive the majority of the deep dives. However, in senior and staff+ interviews, the level of agency and ownership expected of the candidate increases. They should be able to proactively look around corners and identify potential issues with their design, proposing solutions to address them."

For example, if you use websockets, expect that they may ask you what it does and how they work (at a high level). In short, the interviewer is not taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.",
