But, for the uninitiated, LeetCode is a platform that helps software engineers prepare for coding interviews. It offers a vast collection of coding problems, ranging from easy to hard, and provides a platform for users to answer questions and get feedback on their solutions. They also run periodic coding competitions."

              "Another great option is to run user submitted code in aserverless function. Serverless functions are small, stateless, event-driven functions that run in response to triggers (e.g. an HTTP request). They are managed by a cloud provider and automatically scale up or down based on demand, making them a great option for running code that is CPU intensive or unpredictable in terms of load.",
              "In this approach, we would create a serverless function for each runtime that we support (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Java) that installs the necessary dependencies and runs the code in a sandboxed environment. When a user submits their code, we would trigger the appropriate serverless function to run the code and return the result."

Additionally, serverless functions have resource limits that can impact the performance of long running or resource intensive code. We would need to carefully manage these limits to ensure that we're not running out of resources or hitting performance bottlenecks.",
              "While Serverless (lambda) functions are a great option, I am going to proceed with the container approach given I don't anticipate a significant variance in submission volume and I'd like to avoid any cold start latency. So with our decision made, let's update our high-level design to include a container service that will run the user's code and break down the flow of data through the system.",

For instance, in a mid-level interview, it is entirely reasonable for the interviewer to lead most of the deep dives. However, in senior and staff+ interviews, the expected level of initiative and responsibility from the candidate rises.

Instead, focus on the high-level concepts and how they would help to secure the system. If your interviewer is interested in a particular area, they'll ask you to dive deeper. To be concrete, this means just saying, \"We'd use docker containers while limiting network access, setting CPU and memory bounds, and enforcing a timeout on the code execution\" is likely sufficient.",

              "This solution uses Redis sorted sets to maintain a real-time leaderboard while storing submission results in the main database. When a submission is processed, both the database and the Redis sorted set are updated.

              "Redis sorted sets are an in-memory data structure that allows us to efficiently store and retrieve data based on a score. This is perfect for our use case, as we can update the leaderboard by adding or removing users and their scores, and then retrieve the top N users with the highest scores.",
              "The Redis sorted set uses a key format likecompetition:leaderboard:{competitionId}, with the score being the user's total score or solve time, and the value being the userId. We'd implement an API endpoint likeGET /competitions/:competitionId/leaderboard?top=100. When processing a submission, we'd update Redis with a command likeZADD competition:leaderboard:{competitionId} {score} {userId}. To retrieve the top N users, we'd useZREVRANGE competition:leaderboard:{competitionId} 0 N-1 WITHSCORES.",
              "Then, when a user requests the leaderboard, we'll send them the first couple pages of results to display (maybe the top 1,000). Then, as they page via the client, we can fetch the next page of results from the server, updating the UI in the process."

The 5-second delay is generally acceptable for most users. It significantly reduces load on the main database and scales well for our expected user base. Of course, we could lower the polling frequency if needed as well, but 5 seconds is likely more than good enough given the relative infrequency of leaderboard updates.",

The Redis Sorted Set with Periodic Polling solution strikes a good balance between real-time updates and system simplicity. It's more than adequate for our needs and can be easily scaled up if required in the future.",
              "If we find that the 5-second interval is too frequent, we can easily adjust it. We could even implement a progressive polling strategy where we poll more frequently (e.g., every 2 seconds) during the last few minutes of a competition and less frequently (e.g., every 10 seconds) at other times.",

The reality is that 100k is still not a lot of users, and our API server, via horizontal scaling, should be able to handle this load without any issues.

              "This is a good time to do a bit of math. If we estimate a peak of 10k submission at a time (imagine its a competition) and each submission runs against ~100 test case. We are likely to become CPU bound very quickly. Let's make the assumption that each test case takes 100ms to run. This means that each submission will take 10s to run. If we have 10k submissions, that's 100k test cases, which will take 10k seconds to run. That's over 27 hours and we would need approximately 1,667 CPU cores to handle this load within one minute. This clearly indicates that vertical scaling alone, especially considering the limitations with current maximum AWS instance types like AWS's X1 having only 128 cores, is not a viable solution.",

              "One important thing to note is that the introduction of the queue has made the system asynchronous. This means that the API server will no longer be able to return the results of the submission immediately. Instead, the user will need to poll the server for the results. We introduce a new endpoint, sayGET /check/:id, that is polled every second by the client to check if the submission has been processed. It simply looks up the submission in the database and returns the results if they are available or returns a \"processing\" message if not.",

This is a nice to have feature that could be useful in the event of a container crash or other issue that prevents the code from running successfully. We'd simply requeue the submission and try again. Also, having that buffer could help you sleep at night knowing you're not going to lose any submissions, even in the event of a sudden spike in traffic (which I would not anticipate happening in this system).",

You should be able to discuss the pros and cons of running code in a container vs a VM vs a serverless function and be able to justify your choice. You should also be able to break out of box drawing mode and discuss how you would actually run test cases against user code."

That said, if I did, I would expect that they would be able to drive the entire conversation, proactively identifying potential issues with the design and proposing solutions to address them. They should be able to discuss the trade-offs between different approaches and justify their decisions. They should also be able to discuss how they would actually run test cases against user code and how they would handle running code in a secure and isolated manner while meeting the 5 second response time requirement. They would ideally design a very simple system free of over engineering, but with a clear path to scale if needed.",
