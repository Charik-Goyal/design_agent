          "We landed on Server Sent Events (SSE) being the appropriate technology. Now we need to figure out how to scale it. With SSE, we need to maintain an open connection for each viewer. Modern servers and operating systems can handle large numbers of concurrent connectionsâ€”commonly in the range of 100k. Realistically, system resources like CPU, memory, and file descriptors become the bottleneck before you hit any theoretical limit. If we want to support many millions of concurrent viewers, we simply won't be able to do it on a single machine. We must scale horizontally by adding more servers.",
          "The question then becomes how do we distribute the load across multiple servers and ensure each server knows which comments to send to which viewers?",
          "Contrary to a common misconception, the capacity isn't limited to 65,535 connections. That number refers to the range of port numbers, not the number of connections a single server port can handle. Each TCP connection is identified by a unique combination of source IP, source port, destination IP, and destination port. With proper OS tuning and resource allocation, a single listening port can handle hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent SSE connections.",

              "To distribute incoming traffic evenly across our multiple servers we can use a simple load balancing algorithm likeround robin. Upon connecting to a Realtime Messaging Server through the load balancer, the client needs to send a message informing the server of which live video it is watching. The Realtime Messaging Server then updates a mapping in local memory with this information. This map would look something like this:",

              "A pub/sub system is a messaging system that uses a publish/subscribe model. Publishers send messages to a channel or topic, and subscribers receive messages from a channel or topic. In our case, the comment management service would publish a message to a channel whenever a new comment is created. The Realtime Messaging Servers would all subscribe to this channel and receive the message. They would then send the comment to all the viewers that are watching the live video."

            "content": [
              "To address the issue of servers handling viewers from many different live videos, we need a more intelligent allocation strategy. The goal is to have each server primarily handle viewers of the same live video, making it easier to limit the number of topics or channels each server needs to subscribe to.",
              "There are two ways we can achieve this allocation, both require some scripting or configuration.",
              "Option 1: Intelligent Routing via Scripts or ConfigurationA Layer 7 load balancer or API gateway can leverageconsistent hashingbased on theliveVideoId. By inspecting the requestâ€”such as a header or path parameter that includes theliveVideoIdâ€”the load balancer can apply a hashing function that always routes viewers of the same video to the same server. Tools like NGINX or Envoy can be scripted with Lua or configuration directives to achieve this content-based routing, reducing overhead and keeping related viewers together.",
              "Option 2: Dynamic Lookup via a Coordination Service (e.g.,ZooKeeper)Instead of relying on hashing alone, we can store a dynamic mapping ofliveVideoIdto a specific server in a coordination service like Zookeeper. The load balancer or custom proxy layer queries Zookeeper to determine the correct server for eachliveVideoId. As traffic patterns change, new servers can register themselves or existing mappings can be updated in Zookeeper, and the load balancer will route future requests accordingly. This approach offers more flexibility but introduces operational complexity and requires caching and careful failure handling.",
              "The reality is this is pretty complex, and you would not be expected to go into too much detail here in an interview. Just explaining that you need a way to colocate viewers of the same live video to the same server is good enough. Then mention what some high level options would be.",
              "Pub/Sub with Layer 7 Load Balancer",
              "Advanced candidates may point out the tradeoffs in different pub/sub systems. For example, Kafka is a popular pub/sub system that is highly scalable and fault-tolerant, but it has a hard time adapting to scenarios where dynamic subscription and unsubscription based on user interactions, such as scrolling through a live feed or switching live videos, is required. Redis pub/sub provides low latency but offers no message persistence (fire-and-forget), which could lead to missed messages during disconnections. Kafka, while having higher latency, provides message persistence and exactly-once delivery semantics, making it more suitable for scenarios where message delivery guarantees are critical.",
              "However, the main concern with Redis is its potential for data loss due to periodic disk writes and the challenges of memory limitation, which could be a bottleneck for scalability. Additionally, while Redis offers high availability configurations like Redis Sentinel or Redis Active-Active, these add to the operational complexity of managing a Redis-based system. The pub/sub solution is the \"correct academic answer\" and should clearly pass the interview, but the reality is choosing the right pub/sub system is a complex decision that requires a deep understanding of the system's requirements and tradeoffs."

              "All our previous approaches relied on a pub/sub system, where each Realtime Messaging Server subscribes to topics and receives comments as they're published. This means the comment creation service doesn't need to know the destination server; it just publishes messages and the right servers pick them up. While standard and effective, this approach adds complexity in managing subscriptions and scaling read-heavy workloads.",
              "An alternative approach inverts the model: the service creating comments directly routes each new comment to the correct Realtime Messaging Server. To achieve this, we introduce a Dispatcher Service. Instead of broadcasting to topics, the Dispatcher Service determines the exact server responsible for the viewers of a given live video and sends the comment there.",
              "So when a new comment comes in, the receiving server asks the Dispatcher Service, \"What are all the other servers I should send this comment to?\"",

This can be stored in memory and periodically refreshed from a consistent store (like Zookeeper or etcd), or updated via heartbeats and registration protocols as servers join or leave.",
              "Registration & Discovery:When a Realtime Messaging Server comes online, it registers with the Dispatcher Service (or the coordination store it consults). The Dispatcher updates its internal mapping to reflect which server is now serving particular live videos. Likewise, if a server scales down or fails, the Dispatcher updates the mapping accordingly.",
              "Direct Routing:Upon receiving a new comment, the comment management service calls the Dispatcher Service to determine the correct server. The Dispatcher uses its current mapping and forwards the comment directly to the responsible Realtime Messaging Server, which then sends it to connected viewers.",
              "Scalability & Redundancy:In high-demand scenarios, multiple Dispatcher instances can run in parallel behind a load balancer. They all consult the same coordination data, ensuring consistency. This replication adds redundancy, making the system more resilient to failures.",

              "The main challenge is ensuring the Dispatcher Service's mapping is accurate and up-to-date. Rapid changes in viewer distribution (e.g., a viral stream causing a sudden influx of viewers) require that the Dispatcher's view of the system be refreshed frequently. This might involve coordination services like Zookeeper or etcd, which must efficiently propagate changes to all Dispatcher instances.",
              "Another difficulty is maintaining consistency across multiple Dispatcher instances. If they each cache routing information, updates must be coordinated to prevent stale mappings. Strong consistency can be achieved through a distributed coordination service, careful cache invalidation policies, and possibly a leader election mechanism to manage updates safely.",
              "Both the pub/sub approach with viewer co-location and the dispatcher service approach are great solutions. The pub/sub is typically easier with fewer corner cases, so it is the one I would use in an interview, but both are \"correct\" answers."

You should be able to craft a high-level design that meets the functional requirements you've defined, but many of the components will be abstractions with which you only have surface-level familiarity.",
          "Probing the Basics:Your interviewer will spend some time probing the basics to confirm that you know what each component in your system does. For example, if you add an API Gateway, expect that they may ask you what it does and how it works (at a high level). In short, the interviewer is not taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.",
          "Mixture of Driving and Taking the Backseat:You should drive the early stages of the interview in particular, but the interviewer doesn't expect that you are able to proactively recognize problems in your design with high precision. Because of this, it's reasonable that they will take over and drive the later stages of the interview while probing your design.",

It's crucial that you demonstrate a deep understanding of key concepts and technologies relevant to the task at hand.",

You're also expected to understand some of the challenges that come with it and discuss detailed scaling strategies (it's ok if this took some probing/hints from the interviewer). Your ability to navigate these advanced topics with confidence and clarity is key.",

You justify your decisions and explain the trade-offs involved in your design choices.",

The interviewer knows you know the small stuff (REST API, data normalization, etc) so you can breeze through that at a high level so you have time to get into what is interesting.",

You should be able to identify and solve issues independently, demonstrating a strong ability to recognize and address the core challenges in system design. This involves not just responding to problems as they arise but anticipating them and implementing preemptive solutions. Your interviewer should intervene only to focus, not to steer.",
          "Practical Application of Technology: You should be well-versed in the practical application of various technologies. Your experience should guide the conversation, showing a clear understanding of how different tools and systems can be configured in real-world scenarios to meet specific requirements.",
          "Complex Problem-Solving and Decision-Making: Your problem-solving skills should be top-notch. This means not only being able to tackle complex technical challenges but also making informed decisions that consider various factors such as scalability, performance, reliability, and maintenance.",

This includes a thorough understanding of distributed systems, load balancing, caching strategies, and other advanced concepts necessary for building robust, scalable systems.",
