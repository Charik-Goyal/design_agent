For each of these post IDs we'll query thePost Servicefor the created timestamp. Once we retrieve these timestamps, we can sort the posts in the Search Service and return to the user.",

              "The biggest problem with this approach is that the number of Post IDs might be very large for common keywords. If a keyword like \"Taylor\" has 10s of millions of results, we could easily have payloads returned from our index which are 100s of megabytes. In addition, for each of these results we need to make a lookup - 10s of millions of them. Finally, sorting millions of items at request time adds unnecessary latency to our system."

              "In addition to the Redis search cache, we can also utilize edge caching via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS Cloudfront. Most CDNs operate like a big set of geographically-spread HTTP caches. You configure an \"origin\" or target for the cache and configure DNS to route through the CDN. If the cache has the item the user is looking for, it can return it faster than almost any alternative option: most CDNs have locations very close to most users. If it doesn't hit the cache, the CDN will proxy the request back to your servers to handle.",
              "Using the CDN here is simple: on the response to our/searchendpoint, we can addcache-controlheaders which tell our CDN when and for how long to cache a result. When a user tries to hit our search service, they'll first go through a geographically local CDN host. In the case of a cache hit, these users will get results in 10s of milliseconds vs the 100s which might have been required if they had to go through our API gateway, to the search service, via a call to the search cache, and back through. If it's not in the cache, we get a request as usual.",

So instead of 10m single-word keywords, we might end up with 100m+ indexed keys.",

By using a log/stream like Kafka, we can fan out the creation requests to multiple ingestion instances and partition the load.

If a post receives 1 like per minute uniformly over a day, even though it receives 1,440 likes over that day we don't get any benefit from the batcher since we still have to write 1 like per minute. Worse, we introduce some additional overhead."

          "First, we can put caps and limits on each of our inverted indexes. We probably won't need all 10M posts with \"Mark\" contained somewhere in their contents. By keeping our indexes to 1k-10k items, we can reduce the necessary storage by orders of magnitude.",
          "Next, most keywords won't be searched often or even at all. Based on our search analytics, we can run a batch job to move rarely used keywords to a less frequently accessed but ultimately cheaper storage. One way to do this is to move these keyword indexes to cold, blob storage like S3 or R2.",
          "On a regular basis we'll determine which keywords were rarely (or not at all) accessed in the past month. We'll move these indexes from our in-memory Redis instance to a blob in our blob storage. When the index needs to be queried, we'll first try to query Redis. If we don't get our keyword there, we can query the index from our blob storage with a small latency penalty.",

          "Breadth vs. Depth: A mid-level candidate will be mostly focused on breadth. As an approximation, you‚Äôll show 80% breadth and 20% depth in your knowledge. You should be able to craft a high-level design that meets the functional requirements you've defined, but the optimality of your solution will be icing on top rather than the focus.Probing the Basics: Your interviewer will spend some time probing the basics to confirm that you know what each component in your system does. For example, if you're using a cache, expect to be asked about your eviction policy. Your interviewer will not be taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.Mixture of Driving and Taking the Backseat: You should drive the early stages of the interview in particular, but your interviewer won't expect that you are able to proactively recognize problems in your design with high precision. Because of this, it‚Äôs reasonable that they take over and drive the later stages of the interview while probing your design.The Bar for Post Search: For this question, interviewers expect a mid-level candidate to have clearly defined the API endpoints and data model, and created both the sides of the system: ingestion and query. In instances where the candidate uses a ‚ÄúBad‚Äù solution, the interviewer will expect a good discussion but not that the candidate immediately jumps to a great (or sometimes even good) solution."

          "Depth of Expertise: As a senior candidate, your interviewer expects a shift towards more in-depth knowledge ‚Äî about 60% breadth and 40% depth. This means you should be able to go into technical details in areas where you have hands-on experience.Advanced System Design: You should be familiar with advanced system design principles. Certain aspects of this problem should jump out to experienced engineers (write volume, storage, lots of duplicate inputs) and your interviewer will be expecting you to have reasonable solutions.Articulating Architectural Decisions: Your interviewer will want you to clearly articulate the pros and cons of different architectural choices, especially how they impact scalability, performance, and maintainability. You should be able to justify your decisions and explain the trade-offs involved in your design choices.Problem-Solving and Proactivity: You should demonstrate strong problem-solving skills and a proactive approach. This includes anticipating potential challenges in your designs and suggesting improvements. You need to be adept at identifying and addressing bottlenecks, optimizing performance, and ensuring system reliability.The Bar for Post Search: For this question, a senior candidate is expected to speed through the initial high level design so we can spend time discussing, in detail, how to optimize the critical paths. At a bare minimum the solution should have both ingestion and query detailed, with a proper reverse index, and appropriate caching strategy."

          "Emphasis on Depth: As a staff+ candidate, the expectation is a deep dive into the nuances of system design ‚Äî the interviewer is looking for about 40% breadth and 60% depth in your understanding. This level is all about demonstrating that \"been there, done that\" expertise. You should know which technologies to use, not just in theory but in practice, and be able to draw from your past experiences to explain how they‚Äôd be applied to solve specific problems effectively. Your interviewer knows you know the small stuff (REST API, data normalization, etc) so you can breeze through that at a high level so we have time to get into what is interesting.High Degree of Proactivity: At this level, your interviewer expects an exceptional degree of proactivity. You should be able to identify and solve issues independently, demonstrating a strong ability to recognize and address the core challenges in system design. This involves not just responding to problems as they arise but anticipating them and implementing preemptive solutions.Practical Application of Technology: You should be well-versed in the practical application of various technologies. Your experience should guide the conversation, showing a clear understanding of how different tools and systems can be configured in real-world scenarios to meet specific requirements.Complex Problem-Solving and Decision-Making: Your problem-solving skills should be top-notch. This means not only being able to tackle complex technical challenges but also making informed decisions that consider various factors such as scalability, performance, reliability, and maintenance.Advanced System Design and Scalability: Your approach to system design should be advanced, focusing on scalability and reliability, especially under high load conditions. This includes a thorough understanding of distributed systems, load balancing, caching strategies, and other advanced concepts necessary for building robust, scalable systems.The Bar for Post Search: For a staff+ candidate, expectations are set high regarding depth and quality of solutions, particularly for the complex scenarios discussed earlier. Your interviewer will be looking for you to be getting through several of the deep dives, showcasing not just proficiency but also innovative thinking and optimal solution-finding abilities. A crucial indicator of a staff+ candidate's caliber is the level of insight and knowledge they bring to the table. A good measure for this is if the interviewer comes away from the discussion having gained new understanding or perspectives. There are a lot of different ways to solve this problem.",
