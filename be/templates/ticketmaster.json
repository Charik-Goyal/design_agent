Everything else shows your product thinking, but clearly note it as \"below the line\" so the interviewer knows you won't be including them in your design.

In this method, the database is directly utilized to lock a specific ticket row, ensuring exclusive access to the first user trying to book it. This is typically done using theSELECT FOR UPDATEstatement in PostgreSQL, which locks the selected row(s) as part of a database transaction. The lock on the row is maintained until the transaction is either committed or rolled back. During this time, other transactions attempting to select the same row withSELECT FOR UPDATEwill be blocked until the lock is released. This ensures that only one user can process the ticket booking at a time.",

Keeping a transaction open for a long period (like the 5-minute lock duration) is generally not advisable. It can strain database resources and increase the risk of lock contention and deadlocks. Additionally, SQL DBs like PostgreSQL doesn't natively support lock timeouts within transactions. Implementing a timeout would require application-level management and additional complexity. Finally, this approach may not scale well under high load, as prolonged locks can lead to increased wait times for other users and potential performance bottlenecks. Handling edge cases, such as application crashes or network issues, becomes more challenging, as these could leave locks in an uncertain state."

We could use a cron job to periodically query for rows with \"reserved\" status where the time elapsed exceeds the lock duration and then set them back to \"available\". This is much better, but the lag between the elapsed time and the time the row is changed is not ideal for popular events. Ideally, the lock should be removed almost exactly after expiration."

The node query cache in Elasticsearch is an LRU cache shared by all shards on a node, caching results of queries used in the filter. Additionally, Elasticsearch's shard-level request cache is used for caching search responses consisting of aggregation. This can be used for adaptive caching strategies, where the system learns and caches results of the most frequently executed queries over time.",

For example, this could mean integratingAWS CloudFront.

You should be able to craft a high-level design that meets the functional requirements you've defined, but many of the components will be abstractions with which you only have surface-level familiarity.",
          "Probing the Basics:Your interviewer will spend some time probing the basics to confirm that you know what each component in your system does. For example, if you add an API Gateway, expect that they may ask you what it does and how it works (at a high level). In short, the interviewer is not taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.",

It's crucial that you demonstrate a deep understanding of key concepts and technologies relevant to the task at hand.",

Your ability to navigate these advanced topics with confidence and clarity is key.",
