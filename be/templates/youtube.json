          "Video Codec- A video codec compresses and decompresses digital video, making it more efficient for storage and transmission. Codec is an abbreviation for \"encoder/decoder.\" Codecs attempt to reduce the size of the video while preserving quality. Codecs usually trade-off on the following: 1) time required to compress a file, 2) support on different platforms, 3) compression efficiency (a.k.a. how much the original file is reduced in size), and 4) compression quality (lossy or not). Some popular codecs include: H.264, H.265 (HEVC), VP9, AV1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4.",
          "Video Container- A video container is a file format that stores video data (frames, audio) and metadata. A container might house information like video transcripts as well. It differs from a codec in the sense that a codec determines how a video is compressed / decompressed, whereas a container dictates file format for how the video is stored. Support for video containers varies by device / OS.",
          "Bitrate- The bitrate of a video is the number of bits transmitted over a period of time, typically measured in kilobytes per second (kbps) or megabytes per second (mbps). The size and quality of the video affect the bitrate. High resolution videos with higher framerates (measured in FPS) have significantly higher bitrates vs. low resolution videos at lower framerates. This is because there's literally more data that needs to be transferred in order for the video to play. Compression via codecs can also have an effect on bitrate, as more efficient compression can lead to a larger video being compressed to a much smaller size prior to transmission.",
          "Manifest Files- Manifest files are text-based documents that give details about video streams. There's typically 2 types of manifest files:primaryandmediafiles. Aprimarymanifest file lists all the available versions of a video (the different formats). The primary is the \"root\" file and points to media manifest files, each representing a different version of the video. A video version is typically split into small segments, each a few seconds long. Media manifest files list out the links to these clip files and are used by video players to stream video by serving as an \"index\" to these segments.",

          "For the video metadata, we are assuming an upload rate of ~1M videos/day. This means, over the course of the year, we'll have ~365M records in the database representing videos. As a result, we should consider storing video metadata in a database that can be horizontally partitioned, such as Cassandra. Cassandra offers high availability and enables us to choose a partition key for our data. We can partition on thevideoId, since we aren't really worried about bulk-accessing videos in this design, just querying individual videos.",
          "When designing a data storage solution that needs to scale, it's worthwhile to think about partitioning. Some systems necessitate careful partitioning such that data can be read from a single or a handful of nodes. Other systems require consistency within some scoped domain, necessitating a relational DB (with ACID guarantees) sharded by a key that represents that domain, e.g. Ticketmaster might shard by concert ID to ensure consistency of ticket purchases. However, there's some systems that don't require careful partitioning at all; for this system, we can shard byvideoIdbecause we'd only ever do a point look-up byvideoId.",
          "For storing video data, we can see some overlap with this problem and theDropbox interview question. The TL;DR is that it's most efficient to upload data directly to a blob store like S3 via a presigned URL withmulti-part upload. Feel free to read our write-up on Dropbox for an analysis of that part of the system.",
          "The design decision to upload directly to S3 means we have to change ourPOST /uploadAPI to aPOST /presigned_urlAPI. The server will create a presigned URL to enable the client to upload directly to S3. The request payload will just be the video metadata, vs. the metadata and the video file.",

The client would then load the first segment for the video, which would be a few seconds in length. This would allow the user to start watching the video quickly without excess loading. In the background, the client would start loading more segments so that it could continue playing the video seamlessly.",

Additionally, this approach doesn't take into account fluctuating network constraintswhilea user is watching a video. If a 1080p video is streamed and network conditions get worse, loading 1080p segments might get slower, resulting in buffering for the user.",
            "On the surface, it may seem like the \"good\" approach just seems like a 'chunked' download of the video, but it is actually a distinct approach and strictly better / more clear. Some video formats could be stored in order, meaning downloading the file in chunks (e.g. 5MB at a time), it will result in a file stream that is actually playable. However, this isn't always the case for all video formats, and it might be unclear to the interviewer that this approach is actually resulting in data that can be played back to the user with a quick turnaround time. Because the \"good\" solution involves dividing a video into playable segments, it more clearly conveys the means by which the video can be quickly and incrementally played, and it's strictlycloserto the \"great\" solution below."

It also relies on a manifest file being created during video upload time, which references all the video segments that are available in different formats. Think of a manifest file as an \"index\" for all the different video segments with different formats; it will be used by the client to stream segments of video as network conditions vary (see an examplehere).",
            "The client will execute the following logic when streaming the video:",
            "The client will fetch theVideoMetadata, which will have a URL pointing to the manifest file in S3.",
            "The client will download the manifest file.",
            "The client will choose a format based on network conditions / user settings. The client retrieves the URL for this segment in its chosen format from the manifest file. The client will download the first segment.",
            "The client will play that segment and begin downloading more segments.",
            "If the client detects that network conditions are slowing down (or improving), it will vary the format of the video segments it is downloading. If network conditions get worse (e.g. the bitrate is lower), the client will attempt to download more compressed, lower resolution segments to avoid any interruption in streaming.",
            "Adaptive bitrate streaming",
            "This approach is the most complex and involves the client being a more active participant in the system (which isn't a bad thing). It also relies on upstream design decisions involving video splitting by segments, variance of format storage, and the creation of manifest files."

          "Create manifest files referencing the different segments in different video formats.",
          "Mark the upload as \"complete\".",
          "Of note, this design assumes that we upload the original video in full first, before we start processing / splitting. Some video services start processing earlier if the client splits up the video on upload into segments. This enables a \"pipeline\" where the client uploads part of the video and the downstream work can happen before the client is even done uploading the full original foramt. For the sake of simplicity, we avoid this approach, but this is an additional optimization we can consider if we want to speed up the upload experience for the user.",
          "This series of operations can be thought of as a \"graph\" of work to be done. Each operation is a step with some fan-out / fan-in of work based on what \"dependencies\" exist. The segment processing (transcoding, audio processing, transcription) can be done in parallel on different worker nodes since there's no dependencies between segments and the segments have been \"split up\". Given the graph of work and the one-way dependencies, the work to be done here can be considered a directed, acyclic graph, or a \"DAG.\"",
          "For this DAG of work, the most expensive computation to be performed is the video segment transcoding. Ideally, this work is done with extreme parallelism and on many different computers (and cores), given the CPU-bound nature of converting a video from one codec to another.",
          "Additionally, for actually orchestrating the work of this DAG, an orchestrator system can be used to handle building the graph of work to be done and assigning worker nodes work at the right time. We can assume we're using an existing technology to do this, such asTemporal.",
          "Finally, for any temporary data produced in this pipeline (segments, audio files, etc), S3 can be used to avoid passing files between workers. URLs can be passed around to reference said files.",
          "Below is how our system might look with our post-processor DAG drawn out:",
          "How can we handle processing a video to support adaptive bitrate streaming?",
          "We don't need to draw out a full DAG with exact steps and precise examples of transcoding, audio processing, etc. Rather, it's important to dive into the explicit inputs and outputs of video post-processing, and understand how we can process videos in a scalable and efficient way. Given the parallelism and orchestration that is required to efficiently process a video, detailing a DAG solution makes sense here."

          "Our system assumes that ~1M videos are uploaded per day and that 100M videos are watched per day. This is a lot of traffic and necessitates that all of our systems scale and ensure a solid experience for end users.",

          "Video Service- This service is stateless and will be responsible for responding to HTTP requests for presigned URLs and video metadata point queries. It can be horizontally scaled and has a load balancer proxying it.",
          "Video Metadata- This is a Cassandra DB and will horizontally scale efficiently due to Cassandra's leaderless replication and internal consistent hashing. Videos will be uniformly distributed as the data will be partitioned byvideoId.Of note, a node that houses a popular video might become \"hot\" of that video is popular, which could be a bottleneck.",
          "Video Processing Service- This service can scale to a high number of videos and can have internal coordination around how it distributes DAG work across worker nodes. Of note, this service will likely have some internal queuing mechanism that we don't visualize. This queue system will allow it to handle bursts in video uploads. Additionally, the number of jobs in the queue might be a trigger for this system to elastically scale to have more worker nodes.",
          "S3- S3 scales extremely well to high traffic / high file volumes. It is multi-region and can elastically scale.However, the data center that houses S3 might be far from some % of users streaming the video if the video is streamed by a wide audience, which might slow down the initial loading of a video or cause buffering for those users.",
          "Based on the above analysis, we identified a few opportunities to improve our design's ability to scale and provide a great user experience to a wide userbase.",
          "To address the \"hot\" video problem, we can consider tuning Cassandra to replicate data to a few nodes that can share the burden of storing video metadata. This will mean that several nodes can service queries for video data. Additionally, we can add a cache that will store accessed video metadata. This cache can store popular video metadata to avoid having to query the DB for it. The cache can be distributed, use the least-recently-used (LRU) strategy, and partitioned onvideoIdas well. The cache would be a faster way to retrieve data for popular videos and would insulate the DB a bit.",
          "To address the streaming issues for users who might be far away from data centers with S3, we can consider employing CDNs. CDNs could cache popular video files (both segmentsandmanifest files) and would be geographically proximate to many users via a network of edge servers. This would mean that video data would have to travel a significantly shorter distance to reach users, reducing slowness / buffering. Also, if all the data (manifest files and segments) was in the CDN, then the service would never need to interact with the backend at all to continue streaming a video.",

          "Speeding up uploads: Our design above assumes that the client uploads the entire video file first, before it's post-processed (segmented, transcoded, manifest files generated). To speed up uploads, we might consider \"pipelining\" the upload and post-processing. The client can segment the video and upload segments, and the backend can take those segments and immediately operate on them. This requires the client to play a role in video processing and could create \"garbage\" video segments if a video isn't fully uploaded, but on average, this would help improve the user experience and make uploads faster.",

You should be able to craft a high-level design that meets the functional requirements you've defined, but many of the components will be abstractions with which you only have surface-level familiarity.",
          "Probing the Basics:Your interviewer will spend some time probing the basics to confirm that you know what each component in your system does. For example, if you add an API Gateway, expect that they may ask you what it does and how it works (at a high level). In short, the interviewer is not taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.",

Because of this, itâ€™s reasonable that they will take over and drive the later stages of the interview while probing your design.",

I don't expect candidates to know in-depth information about video streaming, but the candidate should converge on ideas involving multipart upload and segment-based streaming. I also expect the candidate to understand the need to interface with a system like S3 directly for upload / streaming.

It's crucial that you demonstrate a deep understanding of key concepts and technologies relevant to the task at hand.",
