            "Like the Distributed Post Cache above, a great solution for this problem is to insert a replicated cache between the readers of the Post table and the table itself. Since posts are very rarely edited, we can keep a long time to live (TTL) on the posts and have our cache evict posts that are least recently used (LRU). As long as our cache is big enough to house our most popular posts, the vast majority of requests to the Post Table will instead hit our cache.",
            "Unlike the Distributed Post Cache solution above, we can choose to have multiple distinct caches that our readers can hit. If we have N hosts with M memory, in the limit we'll create N distinct caches with a total effective cachable space of size M (instead of N*M above) but with N times as much throughput. This means we can evenly distribute the load of a viral post across our entire cache fleet.",
            "Redundant Post Cache",
            "In this case, we will have a smaller number of posts across our cache than if we chose to distribute or partition the posts. This is probably ok since our DynamoDB backing store can handlesomevariability in read throughput and is still fast."

You should be able to craft a high-level design that meets the functional requirements you've defined, but many of the components will be abstractions with which you only have surface-level familiarity.",
          "Probing the Basics:Your interviewer will spend some time probing the basics to confirm that you know what each component in your system does. For example, if you add an API Gateway, expect that they may ask you what it does and how it works (at a high level). In short, the interviewer is not taking anything for granted with respect to your knowledge.",
          "Mixture of Driving and Taking the Backseat:You should drive the early stages of the interview in particular, but the interviewer doesn’t expect that you are able to proactively recognize problems in your design with high precision. Because of this, it’s reasonable that they will take over and drive the later stages of the interview while probing your design.",

This means you should be able to go into technical details in areas where you have hands-on experience. It's crucial that you demonstrate a deep understanding of key concepts and technologies relevant to the task at hand.",
          "Advanced System Design: You should be familiar with advanced system design principles. For example, knowing approaches for handling fan-out is essential. You'll also be expected to iteratively diagnose performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements. Your ability to navigate these advanced topics with confidence and clarity is key.",

You justify your decisions and explain the trade-offs involved in your design choices.",

The interviewer knows you know the small stuff (REST API, data normalization, etc) so you can breeze through that at a high level so you have time to get into what is interesting.",

You should be able to identify and solve issues independently, demonstrating a strong ability to recognize and address the core challenges in system design. This involves not just responding to problems as they arise but anticipating them and implementing preemptive solutions. Your interviewer should intervene only to focus, not to steer.",

This means not only being able to tackle complex technical challenges but also making informed decisions that consider various factors such as scalability, performance, reliability, and maintenance.",

This includes a thorough understanding of distributed systems, load balancing, caching strategies, and other advanced concepts necessary for building robust, scalable systems.",
